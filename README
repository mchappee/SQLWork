Below is the original README that I'll leave for posterity.  SQLWork is an
application that I wrote long, long ago to fill a need for a graphical, full-featured
SQL executor with features such as explain plan, table-based output/editing, exporting,
saving, etc.  I recently got it compiled and running on centos 8.4, which was
kinda cool:



SQLWork is a visual SQL (Structured Query Language) input and retrieval
program. It is useful for both DBAs and database developers. Query Results can
be displayed in plain text or in grid form and (where supported by the
database) query plans may be viewed as an aid to database performance tuning.

SQLWork is the companion tool to Orasoft's Object Manager a graphical database
navigation and administration tool. Both tools are released under the GNU
General Public License.

Commercial support for these tools is available from Advantio
(www.advantio.com).

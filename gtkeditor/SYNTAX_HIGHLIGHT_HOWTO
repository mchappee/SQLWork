Hello,

  If you're reading this then you are thinking about 
jacking with my syntax highlighting.  Well, it's about 
time.  It's pretty bad.  I'd much rather write code than
play with the tokens.  Anyway, here's the skinny on doing
this highlighting thing:

Edit the file plsql.s.  In there you will see the keywords
organized like: 
"keyword"   |

Add additional keywords into an existing catagory.  That's
the simplest solution.  Once finished run the ./buildscanner 
script.  It will call ./scannertool, and then flex.  Once it's 
finished you can do a 'make' to compile the library.  Once
that's finished you can compile OM.

Matthew

Some of these are now done, or partly done.

Fill out the rest of the holes in functionality (there aren't too many now,
apart from the bookmarks stuff I think that the main one is printing).
(mostly done, postscript printing is the main missing feature)

Make export work for mySQL (the type codes are the old Oracle ones so the
export code won't know when to quote strings etc.)
(done altough the translation of Oracle types to generic column type
codes isn't complete)

Finish the mySQL statement scanner so it understands comments, strings
and quoted identifiers.
(done)

Finish the Oracle statement scanner so it understands blocks started
by declare/begin, create procedure, create package etc.
(done)

Add support for bind variables for the Oracle back end.  Consider
whether we can use the server side variables in mySQL to mimic bind
variables.

Add support for substitution variables for both Oracle and mySQL.

Look at using GtkEditor for syntax highlighting for the main text
widget and the bookmark edit widget.

Rearrange error handling so that the text of the error message can be
included in the text output.

Support at least "whenever sqlerror ..." from sqlplus (possibly
support this for mySQL without the rollback options) probably with at
least a "prompt the user" extension.

Change the default behaviour on errors in scripts to be to offer to
continue on the dialog.

Look at completion of sql command keywords (fairly easy). Possibly
look at context sensitive completion of sql command keywords (fairly
hard). Possibly then look at context sensitive completion of object
names.

Fix support for object types and longs in the Oracle back end.

Support (or check) query plans for Oracle 7.3

General tidy up of code

Allow DBMS_DBMS_OUTPUT output to be viewed (possibly in a separate
window).
